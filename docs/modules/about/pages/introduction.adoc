The OpenNMS Cisco UCS Plugin lets you monitor the status and collect events and performance metrics of CISCO UCS entities.

After installing the plugin, you must use the Cisco UCS SuperVisor URLs and associated Credentials to add connections.
After that, you can import the Cisco UCS entities into an OpenNMS requisition.
Services will be bound for NetworkElement, ComputeBlade, ComputeRackUnit, EquipmentChassis, EquipmentFex, and EquipmentRackEnclosure.
It then collects these events and associates them with nodes in OpenNMS, as well as collecting performance metrics.
The next section gives a brief overview of basic Cisco UCS terminology.
Installation and configuration procedures follow in the next sections.
